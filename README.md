# IO Operations Output

### Task Requirements

Follow these steps:

* Create a file called **student_register.py**

* Write a program that allows a user to register students for an exam venue.

* First, ask the user how many students are registering.

* Create a for loop that runs for that number of students.

* Each time the loop runs the program should ask the user to enter the
next student ID number.

* Write each of the ID numbers to a text file called **reg_form.txt**

* Include a dotted line after each student ID because this document will be
used as an attendance register, which the students will sign when they arrive at the exam venue.
